On the Frontend, use React/Redux (maybe)
On the server side, use Node/Express
For data persistence, using Mongodb


On initial get request, should send index.html
which renders React App on div #app React App should have
<div #page> which then renders whichever page
the user wants to navigate to onto that div #page

Get object should return
{  Username field:
  Thumbnail field:
  Weight:
  Target Weight:
  Gender:
  Birthday:
  Diet Restricts:
  Foods: []         }
         ^ contains { foodID
                      Name:
                      Amount:
                      Meal;
                      createdAt:
                       }
